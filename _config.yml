          Collaborated with 5 teammates to create a device to help quadriplegic people. The device will help improve their control over their phones. Familiarized with the prototype design by Puffin Technologies to further develop it and improve it. Researched different technologies similar, what other countries have used, the medical information behind people becoming quadriplegic. Built a prototype and created code to go alongside it. Designed Software Architecture for our different devices. We will be used the ATmega328PB and X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1

          Designed the new interface for an older version of a WATT Team app. Collaborated with 10 team members. Analyzed what the rest of the team was developing and implemented it unto what I was creating. Prepared code and documentation for the team to continue the work I had started. Organized transition documents for future interns to understand what the team has been working on. My design will be used in the future releases of the App.

          Designed many games that were instructed by the class, with lab partner. Coded in an MSP430F5529 a similar game to “Space Invader” where the player has to press the numbers from 1-6 in the keypad to “kill” the aliens. The aliens come in random order and the game has different levels of difficulty. Created an adaptation of “Guitar Hero” in the MSP430, having a total of 8 different songs, with 3 levels of difficulty each. Buttons shall be pressed in the time where the corresponding LED is lit and the player gets the note right, else they get it wrong. After a certain amount a GAME OVER screen shows and proper humiliation is given. Received best lab project for these two games, of around 100 students.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
